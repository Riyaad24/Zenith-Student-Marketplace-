# Azure Budget Deployment Plan - No Advertising
# Zenith Student Marketplace (Organic Traffic Only)

## **Revised Cost-Optimized Architecture**

### **Reduced Azure Resources for Low-Traffic Scenario**

#### **Primary Application**
- **Azure App Service**
  - **SKU**: Basic B1 (1 Core, 1.75GB RAM) instead of Premium
  - **Monthly Cost**: ~$13-18 (vs $55-75 Premium)
  - **Suitable for**: <1000 visitors/month organic traffic

#### **Database**
- **Azure Database for MySQL**
  - **SKU**: Burstable B1ms (1 vCore, 2GB RAM) instead of B2s
  - **Monthly Cost**: ~$12-15 (vs $25-35)
  - **Suitable for**: Low concurrent users, organic growth

#### **Optional/Removed Services**
- **Azure CDN**: **REMOVE** (saves $10-30/month)
  - Not needed for low traffic
  - App Service handles static files fine
- **Application Insights**: **Basic tier** (saves $5-20/month)
  - Still monitor but reduced features
- **Storage Account**: **Keep minimal** (~$3-5/month)
  - Only for essential static assets

### **Revised Monthly Costs:**
| Service | Original Cost | Budget Cost | Savings |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| App Service | $55-75 | $13-18 | $40-55 |
| MySQL Database | $25-35 | $12-15 | $13-20 |
| CDN | $10-30 | $0 | $10-30 |
| App Insights | $10-25 | $3-8 | $7-17 |
| Storage | $5-15 | $3-5 | $2-10 |
| Key Vault | $3-5 | $3-5 | $0 |
| **TOTAL** | **$110-185** | **$35-55** | **$75-130** |

## **60-70% Cost Reduction!**

Your monthly Azure costs would be approximately **$35-55** instead of $110-185.

### **What You Still Get:**
✅ Professional ecommerce website
✅ Custom domain (your GoDaddy domain)
✅ SSL certificate (free with Azure)
✅ MySQL database with backups
✅ Secure hosting and monitoring
✅ Room to scale when you grow

### **What We Remove/Reduce:**
❌ Global CDN (not needed for low traffic)
❌ Premium performance tiers
❌ Advanced monitoring features
❌ High-availability configurations

## **Growth Path:**
When your organic traffic grows and you decide to advertise later:
1. **Easy upgrade** to Premium App Service
2. **Add CDN** for global performance
3. **Upgrade database** for more concurrent users
4. **Enable advanced monitoring**

## **Alternative Budget Options:**

### **Option 1: Even Cheaper - Shared Hosting**
- **Azure App Service Free Tier** + **Shared MySQL**
- **Cost**: $0-20/month
- **Limitation**: Custom domain requires paid tier

### **Option 2: Hybrid Approach**
- **Start with Basic tier** ($35-55/month)
- **Upgrade components as traffic grows**
- **Add advertising when ready to scale**
