# Zenith Student Marketplace - Multi-University Support Implementation

## Overview
Successfully updated the Zenith Student Marketplace to support any South African tertiary institution ending in `.ac.za`, expanding beyond the original Richfield-only implementation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Seeding with Multiple Universities
**File: `prisma/seed-multi-university.js`**
- Created comprehensive seed data with students from 6 major South African universities:
  - University of Cape Town (UCT) - `@myuct.ac.za`
  - University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) - `@student.wits.ac.za`
  - University of Pretoria (UP) - `@tuks.co.za`
  - University of Johannesburg (UJ) - `@student.uj.ac.za`
  - Stellenbosch University - `@student.sun.ac.za`
  - Richfield Graduate Institute - `@my.richfield.ac.za`

### 2. Enhanced Email Validation
**File: `lib/validation.ts`**
- Comprehensive list of 30+ recognized South African tertiary institutions
- Regex pattern validation for student number format: `[0-9]+@(my.)?[domain].ac.za`
- Support for both direct domain and `my.` prefix formats
- Institution name mapping for better user experience

### 3. Updated Authentication Pages
**Files: `app/login/page.tsx` & `app/register/page.tsx`**
- Changed branding from "Richfield Student Marketplace" to "South African Student Marketplace"
- Updated placeholder examples to show multiple universities
- Automatic institution detection from email domain
- Real-time validation feedback
