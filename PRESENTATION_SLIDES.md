## Slide 5: Database Schema Highlights
```
📊 COMPREHENSIVE DATA MODEL

Core Models (20+ total):
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│    User     │    │   Product   │    │   Admin     │
│ • Security  │    │ • Inventory │    │ • Audit     │
│ • Roles     │    │ • Reviews   │    │ • Logging   │
│ • Sessions  │    │ • Messages  │    │ • Security  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘

Security-First Design:

```

## Slide 6: API Architecture
```
🔗 RESTful API ENDPOINTS

Authentication:
POST /api/auth/login     → JWT token generation
POST /api/auth/register  → User registration
GET  /api/auth/me        → Current user info

Products:
GET  /api/products       → Browse with filters
POST /api/products       → Create listing
PUT  /api/products/:id   → Update listing

Admin:
GET  /api/admin/users    → User management
GET  /api/admin/stats    → Dashboard analytics
GET  /api/admin/audit    → Security logs
```
